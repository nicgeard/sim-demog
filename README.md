sim-demog
=========

Computational simulation model of population with demography.

'population' directory contains python classes
'test' contains parameters and data files (contemporary Australian population) for a simple testcase

To run the test case, from 'test', execute 'python ../population/main.py'; a population of c10,000 will be simulated for 200 years, and data plots written to an 'output' subdirectory.
